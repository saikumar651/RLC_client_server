the receiver side, can be configured and serves the purpose of reducing the num-
ber of bits transmitted over the radio interface. Especially for small payloads,
such as voice-over-IP and TCP acknowledgments, the size of an uncompressed IP
header is in the same range as the payload itself, 40 bytes for IP v4 and 60 bytes
for IP v6, and can account for around 60% of the total number of bits sent.
Compressing this header to a couple of bytes can therefore increase the spectral
efficiency by a large amount. The header compression scheme in NR is based on
Robust Header Compression (ROHC) [38], a standardized header-compression
framework also used for several other mobile-communication technologies, for
example, LTE. Multiple compression algorithms, denoted profiles, are defined,
each specific to the particular network layer and transport layer protocol combina-
tion such as TCP/IP and RTP/UDP/IP. Header compression is developed to com-
press IP packets. Hence it is applied to the data part only and not the SDAP
header (if present).
Integrity protection ensures that the data originate from the correct source and
ciphering protects against eavesdropping. PDCP is responsible for both these
functions, if configured. Integrity protection and ciphering are used for both the
data plane and the control plane and applied to the payload only and not the
PDCP control PDUs or SDAP headers.
For dual connectivity and split bearers (see Chapter 6, for a more in-depth dis-
cussion on dual connectivity), PDCP can provide routing and duplication func-
tionality. With dual connectivity, some of the radio bearers are handled by the
master cell group, while others are handled by the secondary cell group. There is
also a possibility to split a bearer across both cell groups. The routing functional-
ity of the PDCP is responsible for routing the data flows for the different bearers
to the correct cell groups, as well as han
